4. Two reasons branches are used:
To isolate development of new features and safely test or fix bugs without affecting the main.

5. Difference between git log and git status:
git log shows commit history, while git status shows current working tree changes.

6. Command to see commits where “Vehicle.h” was committed:
git log --follow -- Vehicle.h

7. Command to see commits with “file” in the commit message:
git log --grep="file"

8. context of object-oriented programming:
Inheritance allows one class to use properties/methods of another. Polymorphism – allows different objects to be treated as the same type with different behavior. Encapsulation – restricts direct access to object data and methods to protect integrity.

9. Difference between “Dictator and Lieutenants” and “Integration Manager” workflows:
Integration Manager workflow allows each person to push/pull from the needed repositories, while Dictator and Lieutenants only the "Dictator" can push and handles the merges of his "Lieutenants" who only merge changes for some developers

10. Why a team of 100 benefits from Dictator and Lieutenants over Centralized:
Dictator and Lieutenants scales better by dividing integration work among lieutenants and reduces merge conflicts/bottlenecks.
